The message \"Start sleeping\" suggests it's beginning a sleep operation, but since it ran longer than the 2-second timeout, the process was terminated before it could complete.\n\nIf you want to see what the script contains or understand how long it's supposed to sleep, I can examine the file contents:"},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_013roJbTgUcqWSWAvdpuopoY","name":"bash","input":{"command":"cat ./sleepy.sh"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3244,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":215,"service_tier":"standard"}}
