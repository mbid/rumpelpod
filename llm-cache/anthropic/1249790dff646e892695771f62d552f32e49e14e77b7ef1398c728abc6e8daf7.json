The web_fetch tool doesn't have access to that domain.\n\nHowever, I can explain what would happen if we were able to access `https://httpstat.us/404`: this is a service designed to return specific HTTP status codes for testing purposes. When you request that URL, the server would respond with a 404 (Not Found) status code, typically along with a simple response body indicating the error. This is useful for testing how applications handle HTTP error responses.\n\nIf you'd like to test HTTP status codes, you could also try using curl or wget from the command line if you have those tools available. Would you like me to try that instead?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6346,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":226,"service_tier":"standard","server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":1}}}
