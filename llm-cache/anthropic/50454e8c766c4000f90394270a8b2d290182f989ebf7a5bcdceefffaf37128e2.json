It then appears to enter a sleep state and didn't complete within the timeout period (the script is still running with process ID 187)\n\nThis suggests `sleepy.sh` is a script that performs some kind of sleep operation, likely using a `sleep` command that runs longer than the 2-second timeout limit. The script didn't crash or error—it's just blocked waiting for the sleep command to finish.\n\nWould you like me to look at the script's contents to see what it's supposed to do?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3244,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":146,"service_tier":"standard"}}
