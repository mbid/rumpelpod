Then, call the \"bash\" function to execute `cat greeting.txt`.\n\nIn my previous response, I outputted the function calls in JSON format within <function_call> tags.\n\nNow, the system has simulated the function responses:\n- The \"edit\" function succeeded: \"Successfully edited greeting.txt\"\n- The \"bash\" function would output the content of the file, which is now \"Hello Universe\" based on the context.\n\nIn the conversation history, the function response is: \"Function: Successfully edited greeting.txt\" and then \"Hello Universe\".\n\nI need to formulate my final response to the user.
