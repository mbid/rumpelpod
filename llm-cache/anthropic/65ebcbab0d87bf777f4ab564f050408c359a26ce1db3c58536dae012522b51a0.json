Here's what happened:\n\nThe script started running and printed \"Start sleeping\" to the output, but then it appears to go into a sleep or wait state. The bash command timed out after 2 seconds while the process was still running (PID 1002).\n\nThis suggests that `sleepy.sh` likely contains a `sleep` command or some other blocking operation that causes it to pause for an extended period. The script isn't producing any errors—it's just running a long-duration sleep or similar blocking operation.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Look at the contents of `sleepy.sh` to see what it does?\n2. Run it with a longer timeout?\n3. Run it in the background?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3240,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":166,"service_tier":"standard"}}
