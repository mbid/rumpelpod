Here's what happened:\n\n1. **Output**: The script printed \"Start sleeping\" to the console\n2. **Timeout**: The command ran longer than the 2-second timeout limit and was still executing when the timeout occurred\n\nThis suggests that the script (`sleepy.sh`) is performing some kind of long-running operation, likely involving a `sleep` command (given the name and the \"Start sleeping\" message). The script didn't complete within the 2-second window before the timeout kicked in, so the process (PID 1000) is still running in the background.\n\nWould you like me to check what's in the script to see what it's supposed to do, or would you like to try something else?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3240,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":170,"service_tier":"standard"}}
