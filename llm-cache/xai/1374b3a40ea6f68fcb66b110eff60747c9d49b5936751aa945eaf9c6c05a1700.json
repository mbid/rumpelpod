The output was too large to display fully (over 35,000 bytes), so it wasn't shown in full. Here's what I observed:\n\n- The full output is saved at `/tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373`.\n- To view parts of it, you can use commands like `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373` to see the last 100 lines or `grep` for searching specific content, but I will not run any further tools as per your instructions.\n\nIf you need me to clarify anything else, let me know.","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked me to run exactly one tool: `cat large.txt`, and then stop immediately and tell them what I observed. I did that by making a function call to the \"bash\" action with the command \"cat large.txt\".\n\nNow, the function call has executed, and the response is that the output is too large (35,000 bytes). It provides a path to the full output: /tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373. It suggests using `tail -n 100` or `grep` to view parts of it.\n\nMy instructions are to stop immediately after that single tool call and tell the user what I observed. So, I need to report back on what happened from this execution.\n\nKey points from the function output:\n- The output is too large to display fully.\n- Full output is at /tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373.\n- Suggestions for viewing: tail or grep.\n\nI should not run any other tools, as per the user's request. The user said: \"After that single tool call, stop immediately and tell me what I observed. Do not run any other tools.\"\n\nIn my response, I need to:\n- Describe what I observed from running `cat large.txt`.\n- Since the output is large, I can't show it all, so I should mention that and provide the details given.\n- Keep my response clear and not verbose.\n\nFrom the available context, I have information about Linux commands like tail and grep, which might be relevant here, but I shouldn't use them unless I decide to call another function, which I'm not supposed to do.\n\nFinally, structure my response:\n- Be direct.\n- Report the observation.\n- Do not make another function call.\n\nObservation summary:\n- I ran `cat large.txt`.\n- The output was too large to display fully.\n- It's available at the specified path.\n- Suggestions were given, but I'm just reporting, not acting on them.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2682,"completion_tokens":133,"total_tokens":3211,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2682,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":396,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":260675250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://superuser.com/questions/392156/using-head-or-tail-on-huge-text-file-19-gb","https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/tail-command-linux-examples/","https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/linux-tail-command/","https://github-wiki-see.page/m/The-Bioinformatics-Group/Learning_Unix/wiki/Viewing-and-modifying-large-text-files-(head,-tail,-cat-and-grep)","https://www.scaler.com/topics/tail-command-in-linux/","https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/view-and-follow-the-end-of-text-files-with-tail/","https://superuser.com/questions/516383/whats-the-best-way-to-view-lines-x-through-y-of-a-large-file","https://the.hosting/en/help/linux-tail-and-head-commands-viewing-file-beginning-and-end","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21246752/how-to-view-huge-txt-files-in-linux","https://medium.com/@write2sharadha/working-with-text-files-using-tools-like-cat-head-tail-grep-and-sed-in-linux-e3685b02e5cf","https://www.papertrail.com/solution/tips/how-to-tail-search-and-filter-linux-logs/","https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-use-tail-command","https://www.baeldung.com/linux/large-files","https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-14-tail-and-head-commands-in-linux-unix","https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/Learning_Unix/wiki/Viewing-and-modifying-large-text-files-(head,-tail,-cat-and-grep)","https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/configuration/linux-tail-command/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3229/grep-and-tail-f","https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/tail-and-head","https://www.hostinger.com/in/tutorials/how-to-use-tail-command","https://www.baeldung.com/linux/files-cat-more-less"]}
