To find the secret code at the end of the file, I'll use `tail` on the saved output file.\n\n","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked to run `./once.sh`, which I did by calling the bash function. The response indicates that the output is too large, and it's saved to a file at `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`.\n\nThe user mentioned that the script will print a lot of output and then delete itself, and I need to use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\n\nIn my previous response, I already called the function to run the script. Now, in this turn, I have the output from that function call, which is a message saying the output is large and suggests using `tail`.\n\nTo proceed, I need to follow the user's instructions: use `tail` to read the end of that file.\n\nThe file path is `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`. I can run another bash command to tail that file.\n\nThe user specifically said: \"Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\" So, I should execute a command like `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` or something similar to get the end of the file.\n\nAvailable actions include \"bash\", so I can call it again to run the tail command.\n\nMy response should be clear and not verbose. After running tail, I might need to parse or present the secret code if it's found.\n\nThe web results mention things like secret management and shell scripts, but I should only use them if relevant. Here, it's more about executing the command as per the user's request.\n\nNext step: Call the bash function with the tail command.\n\nFinally, structure my response: If I'm calling a function, use the <function_call> tag.\n\nSo, I'll respond by calling the bash function for the tail command.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_72898012","function":{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2486,"completion_tokens":90,"total_tokens":2950,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2486,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":374,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":259762250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://akondrahman.github.io/files/papers/secdev2021.pdf","https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/","https://www.shellcheck.net/","https://cycode.com/blog/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code/","https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/shell-script-step/","https://github.com/cachix/secretspec/releases","https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret","https://orca.security/resources/blog/detecting-secrets-in-source-code/","https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2026/release-notes","https://www.pcgamesn.com/steal-a-brainrot/codes","https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell","https://www.wiz.io/academy/application-security/open-source-code-security-tools","https://medium.com/@tolubanji/hardcoded-secrets-the-unseen-security-risk-lurking-in-your-code-102396345115","https://smallstep.com/blog/command-line-secrets/","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3830823/hiding-secret-from-command-line-parameter-on-unix","https://cycode.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-secrets-detection/","https://www.gitguardian.com/glossary/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26504661","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/439497/is-there-a-way-to-pass-sensitive-data-in-bash-using-a-prompt-for-any-command","https://www.jit.io/resources/appsec-tools/git-secrets-scanners-key-features-and-top-tools-"]}
