Based on your original query about its meaning, this appears to be a custom or specific code generated by the script.\n\nFrom the web information I have access to:\n- Secret codes generally refer to encrypted messages or hidden symbols used for security, as seen in resources like Vocabulary.com and cryptography explanations (e.g., shifted alphabet codes or TikTok number codes).\n- However, \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\" doesn't directly match any standard codes in the results, suggesting it might be a unique identifier or placeholder in this context.\n\nIf you have more details about the code's origin or need me to perform further actions (like searching for similar patterns or analyzing the full output), let me know!","reasoning_content":"First, the user is asking about the meaning of \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\". From the initial context, I have web results related to secret codes, but nothing directly matches this specific code.\n\nIn the conversation history, the user instructed me to run `./once.sh`, which I did, and then I tailed the output file. The output from the tail command includes the string \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\" at the end.\n\nSo, this string was found in the output of the script. That might be the key here.\n\nThe user's original query was about the meaning of this code, but in this interaction, it seems like we've just retrieved it from the script's output.\n\nNow, I need to respond helpfully. The code was in the output, so perhaps I should inform the user that I've found it and relate it back to their query.\n\nFrom the web results, there are various references to secret codes, like in vocabulary, cryptography, TikTok codes, etc. One result is from PCMag about phone secret codes, and another from Reddit about ChatGPT codes, but nothing specifically about \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nThe most relevant thing is that it appeared in the script's output. Maybe I should check if this matches any of the web results.\n\nLooking at the web results:\n\n- There's a result about TikTok secret number codes.\n\n- Another about secret codes in general.\n\n- One from Reddit about ChatGPT having secret codes.\n\nBut \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\" doesn't directly match any described codes in the excerpts.\n\nHowever, in the output I just received, it's presented as \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", which is exactly the query.\n\nPerhaps the meaning is derived from the context in which it was found. Since it was in the script's output, and the user asked to find it, maybe that's the secret code they were referring to.\n\nThe user said: \"Run `./once.sh`. It will print a lot of output and then delete itself. The output will be saved to a file because it is too large. Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\"\n\nSo, this was a way to reveal the secret code. Now that I've found it, I can confirm it and perhaps look up its meaning using the web results.\n\nIn my response, I should be clear and not verbose. If I need more info, ask, but here, I think I can proceed.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- I could directly answer based on the web results.\n\n- Or, since I have the code now, mention that it's been found and provide any relevant meaning from the web.\n\nFrom the web results, one is: \"TikTok's Secret Number Codes: The Definitive Cheat Sheet\" and it mentions codes like 2789, but not this one.\n\nAnother is about general secret codes.\n\nPerhaps I can say that based on the context, it might be a custom code, and relate it to general definitions.\n\nSince the query was \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765 meaning\", and I have it from the output, I could say: \"The secret code 'SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765' was found in the script output. From web sources, secret codes often refer to encrypted or hidden messages, as described in various cryptography resources.\"\n\nBut I need to be precise.\n\nFinally, decide if I need to call another function. Do I have all I need? Probably yes, as the code is now revealed.\n\nResponse structure: Keep it clear and concise.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3916,"completion_tokens":165,"total_tokens":4796,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3916,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":715,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":266132250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/secret%20code","https://theinformaticists.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/secret-codes/","https://www.rclreads.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2021/05/rmdk_Codes-and-Ciphers.pdf","https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151217-the-secret-codes-youre-not-meant-to-know","https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/secret-language","https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/did-you-know-your-phone-has-secret-codes-that-can-unlock-hidden-features","https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lolmcf/did_you_know_that_chatgpt_has_secret_codes/","https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/shifted-alphabet-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3x004o/what_secret_codes_are_all_around_us_that_only/","https://www.playgroupgame.com/secret-code/","https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-puzzles/0/steps/14024","https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/","https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/secret-code","https://slang.net/blog/tiktok_secret_number_code_meanings","https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/secret+code","https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/secret-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOfBill/comments/1eobtb9/here_are_all_the_secret_codes_ive_gotten_so_far/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/secret-codes-with-meaning/923565169196/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/number-codes-secret-with-meaning/931701020884/","https://secretgeek.net/content/spycodes.pdf"]}
