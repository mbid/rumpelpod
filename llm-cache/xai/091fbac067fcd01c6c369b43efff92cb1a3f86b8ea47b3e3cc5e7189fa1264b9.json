It's saved in the file `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`. Following your instructions, I'll now use `tail` to read the end of that file to look for the secret code.\n\nLet me execute the `tail` command to retrieve the last part of the output.\n\n","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked to run `./once.sh`, which I did via the function call. The response indicates that the output is too large, and it's saved to a file: `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`.\n\nThe user mentioned that the script will print a lot of output and then delete itself, and I need to use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\n\nIn my previous response, I already called the bash function to run `./once.sh`. Now, in this turn, I'm responding to that function's output.\n\nThe function output says: \"Output is too large (82912 bytes). Full output available at /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28. Use `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` to see the end of the output, or `grep` to search.\"\n\nSo, to fulfill the user's request, I need to now use `tail` on that file to get the end of the output, as they suggested.\n\nI can call the bash function again to execute `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` or something similar to extract the secret code.\n\nThe user's original message: \"Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\" So, I should proceed with that.\n\nAvailable actions: I have the \"bash\" function, which I can use to execute another command.\n\nLogical next step: Call the bash function to run the tail command on the output file.\n\nAfter that, I can look for the secret code in the output of that command.\n\nThe search results were about \"secret code from once.sh script output in 2026\", and the current date is 2026, so this might be relevant, but I should base my actions on the user's request.\n\nFinally, once I get the output from tail, I should check if it contains the secret code and present it to the user.\n\nStructure my response: If I need to call another function, I should use the <function_call> tag.\n\nSo, I'll call the bash function for the tail command.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_36209556","function":{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2763,"completion_tokens":131,"total_tokens":3341,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2763,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":447,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":261163250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://smallstep.com/blog/command-line-secrets/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/797597/what-are-the-secure-ways-to-use-credentials-in-bash-scripts","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3980668/how-to-get-a-password-from-a-shell-script-without-echoing","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3830823/hiding-secret-from-command-line-parameter-on-unix","https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/puujxk/where_to_store_credentials_for_bash_scripts/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/439497/is-there-a-way-to-pass-sensitive-data-in-bash-using-a-prompt-for-any-command","https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/1cjalnq/how_do_you_secure_passwords_in_bash_scripts/","https://github.com/jordemort/secrets.sh","https://dev.to/msedzins/sensitive-data-in-bash-scripts-3j5c","https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/4503/access-vault-secret-from-bash-script","https://medium.com/@heinancabouly/bash-secrets-i-learned-from-10-years-of-production-hell-93fe1dbff12a","https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secrets-scripts/","https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/","https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/v6d33t/how_to_avoid_passwords_in_clear_text_in_a_bash/","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18350934/bash-how-to-use-a-secret-file-for-a-script","https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-at-the-command-line/","https://medium.com/@tolubanji/hardcoded-secrets-the-unseen-security-risk-lurking-in-your-code-102396345115","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68435485/is-it-possible-to-use-github-secrets-inside-my-shell-file","https://www.shellscript.sh/first.html","https://dev.to/foresthoffman/combining-github-secrets-and-actions-4081"]}
