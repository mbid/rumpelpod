To find the secret code as you requested, I'll use the `tail` command to view the end of this file, where the code is likely located.\n\nLet me execute that now:\n\n","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked to run `./once.sh`, which I did by calling the bash function. The response indicates that the output is too large and saved to a file at `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`.\n\nThe user mentioned that the script will print a lot of output and then delete itself, and the output is saved to a file. They want me to use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\n\nFrom the initial system prompt, I have access to web results about using tail and grep, which are relevant here.\n\nMy previous response was the function call, and now I'm responding to the output of that function.\n\nThe function output says: \"Output is too large (82912 bytes). Full output available at /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28. Use `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` to see the end of the output, or `grep` to search.\"\n\nTo proceed, I need to help find the secret code in that file using tail or grep, as per the user's request.\n\nThe available actions include \"bash\", which I can use to execute another command, like tail or grep on that file.\n\nLogical next step: Execute a bash command to tail or grep the file to extract the secret code.\n\nThe user specifically said: \"Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\"\n\nI should run a command like `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` or perhaps combine it with grep if needed.\n\nFrom the web results, I know about using tail and grep together, like in ‽web:0, ‽web:1, etc.\n\nTo be precise, I can use tail to get the last few lines and then pipe to grep if I know what to search for. But the user didn't specify the exact string, just to find the \"secret code\".\n\nIn the system prompt, the search query was \"find secret code in bash output file using tail or grep command\", so I should infer that.\n\nI need to call another function to execute the appropriate bash command.\n\nPossible command: `tail -n 50 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28 | grep secret` or something similar, but I don't know the exact string.\n\nThe user said \"find the secret code\", but didn't specify how to identify it. I might need to assume it's at the end or contains certain keywords.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll start by tailing the file and let the output show.\n\nIn my response, I should execute another bash command to process this file.\n\nFinally, structure my response: If I need to call a function, I use the <function_call> tag.\n\nSo, I should call bash with a command like `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` to get the end of the file.\n\nIf the secret code is there, great; otherwise, I might need to follow up.\n\nThe user might expect me to grep for \"secret code\" or something, but since it's not specified, I'll stick to tail as requested.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_31686336","function":{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2834,"completion_tokens":120,"total_tokens":3613,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2834,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":659,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":262381250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://superuser.com/questions/270529/monitoring-a-file-until-a-string-is-found","https://askubuntu.com/questions/685000/tail-a-log-file-but-show-only-specific-lines","https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/tail-command-linux-examples/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3229/grep-and-tail-f","https://serverfault.com/questions/708021/tail-grep-and-count-the-instances-found-in-one-command","https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-monitor-a-file-until-a-string-is-found-bash-grep-tail-logfiles-admin","https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html","https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-grep-command-in-linux-unix/","https://www.baeldung.com/linux/grep-pipe-search-term","https://www.ionos.ca/digitalguide/server/configuration/linux-tail-command/","https://www.scaler.com/topics/tail-command-in-linux/","https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/grep-command-in-unixlinux/","https://superuser.com/questions/1404982/why-isnt-tail-f-grep-q-quitting-when-it-finds-a-match","https://www.w3schools.com/bash/bash_grep.php","https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1f566hc/bash_variable_to_refer_to_the_output_of_the_last/","https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/tail-f-file-grep-search-term-not-working-on-freebsd.73320/","https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/configuration/linux-tail-command/","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16931244/checking-if-output-of-a-command-contains-a-certain-string-in-a-shell-script","https://gist.github.com/jdeathe/f13968cc7592f8a9c9c0693a29c8442c","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41302028/how-to-find-value-of-a-key-on-tail-f"]}
