The output was too large to display fully (approximately 35,000 bytes), so it was not shown in its entirety. The full output is available at the file path `/tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373` for you to access if needed. I will not perform any further actions.","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked me to run exactly one tool: `cat large.txt`, and then stop immediately and tell them what I observed. I did that by calling the bash function with `cat large.txt`.\n\nNow, the function call response indicates that the output is too large (35,000 bytes), and it's available at a specific file path. I need to handle this output and report back as per the user's instructions.\n\nThe user said: \"After that single tool call, stop immediately and tell me what you observed. Do not run any other tools.\" So, I should not make any further function calls. I have to base my response on what I observed from this output.\n\nFrom the function response: \"Output is too large (35000 bytes). Full output available at /tmp/agent/bash-output-09daa28f6373.\" This means I can't display the entire output directly, but I need to describe what I observed.\n\nIn my response, I should:\n\n1. Acknowledge that I ran the command.\n\n2. Describe the observation: The output was too large to display fully.\n\n3. Possibly suggest how they can access it, but I have to be careful not to run another tool.\n\nThe system prompt reminds me of the search results about handling large outputs from cat, so I could reference that implicitly if relevant, but I shouldn't overcomplicate.\n\nKey instructions from the system prompt:\n\n- Keep my response clear and not verbose.\n\n- If something is unclear, ask for clarification, but here it's clear.\n\n- I've already made the function call, so now I'm responding to the user based on that.\n\nStructure my response:\n\n- Start by confirming the action.\n\n- State what I observed: The output is large and not fully shown.\n\n- Mention the file where the full output is available, as per the function response.\n\n- Do not call any other functions, as per user's request.\n\nFinal response should be straightforward: Tell them what I observed from running `cat large.txt`.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2768,"completion_tokens":74,"total_tokens":3240,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2768,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":5},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":398,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":260652750},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://superuser.com/questions/614648/how-can-i-stop-cat-output-immediately-despite-massive-output","https://askubuntu.com/questions/956631/how-to-use-cat-to-see-the-top-of-a-very-long-file","https://superuser.com/questions/564554/how-to-set-max-line-in-cat-command","https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-cat-command","https://labex.io/questions/how-does-cat-handle-large-files-454038","https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/cat-command-in-linux-with-examples/","https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-cat-command","https://www.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/1363yv/a_faster_way_to_cat_files/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/339156/how-does-cat-handle-large-files-when-used-as-part-of-a-pipe","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/288521/with-the-linux-cat-command-how-do-i-show-only-certain-lines-by-number","https://serveracademy.com/blog/the-linux-cat-command/","https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-appleosx-bsd-cat-command-examples/","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/176917/how-to-kill-a-runaway-cat","https://docs.vultr.com/how-to-use-the-cat-command-in-linux","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/47407/cat-line-x-to-line-y-on-a-huge-file","https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/426748/cat-a-very-large-number-of-files-together-in-correct-order","https://askubuntu.com/questions/962019/how-to-cat-file-with-limit-of-printed-characters-from-each-line","https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/41nvlq/how_to_cancel_viewing_a_file_when_accidentally/","https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/linux-cat-command/","https://www.hostinger.com/uk/tutorials/linux-cat-command"]}
