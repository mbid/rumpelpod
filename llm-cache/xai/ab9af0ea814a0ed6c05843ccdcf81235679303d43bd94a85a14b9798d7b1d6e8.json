From the previous message, I know the code is \"ZEBRA_DELTA_9876\".\n\nNow, reviewing the available functions:\n\n1. **bash**: For executing bash commands. This doesn't relate to recalling memory.\n\n2. **edit**: For editing files. Not relevant here.\n\n3. **write**: For writing to a new file. I could potentially write the code to a file, but the user is just asking to recall it, not to store it persistently.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nIs this query addressable by a function? Not directly. The functions are for bash execution, file editing, or writing new files. Recalling information isn't a function; it's something I handle in my response.\n\nI should only use <function_call> if it's the logical next step. Here, the logical step is just to respond with the information I have.\n\nThe instructions also say: \"Do not call a function if no matching functions apply or if parameters are missing/unclear. Ask for clarification only if none of the provided functions are able to advance the user's request.\"\n\nIn this case, no function is needed to advance the request. I can simply answer based on the conversation history.\n\nMy response should be clear and not verbose. So, I'll just state the code.\n\nFinal decision: Respond directly without a function call.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":563,"completion_tokens":19,"total_tokens":930,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":563,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":493},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":348,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0,"cost_in_usd_ticks":2414750},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb"}
