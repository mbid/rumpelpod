Let me review the relevant information from the results:\n\n- Several results mention 2025 as the year when the last penny was minted.\n\n- Specifically:\n\n  - ‽web:2⁊: \"The US minted its last penny on Wednesday.\" Published: 2025-11-14T14:28:01\n\n  - ‽web:4⁊: Refers to the event on 2025-11-12T00:00:00\n\n  - ‽web:6⁊: \"The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia\" on 2025-11-12T13:45:01\n\n  - ‽web:9⁊: \"A long decline into irrelevance ended on Wednesday in Philadelphia.\" Published: 2025-11-12T18:44:53\n\n  - ‽web:11⁊: \"The final penny was minted on Wednesday at the Philadelphia Mint\" on 2025-11-12T23:13:00\n\n  - ‽web:14⁊: \"The last 1-cent coins were made Wednesday at the mint in Philadelphia.\" Published: 2025-11-12T13:45:35\n\n  - ‽web:16⁊: \"The last penny was stamped with the aid of Treasurer Brandon Beach at the Philadelphia U.S. Mint during an event on Wednesday, Nov. 12\"\n\n  - ‽web:19⁊: Refers to the event in 2025-11-12T21:58:15\n\nFrom these, the date consistently points to November 12, 2025.\n\nThe current date is 2026-01-21, so this information is from the past and seems reliable based on multiple sources.\n\nThe user wants the answer in yyyy-mm-dd format, so that would be 2025-11-12.\n\nI need to keep my response clear and not verbose. The system prompt says: \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\"\n\nThis query can be answered directly from the web results I have, so I don't need to call any functions like bash, edit, or write. There's no need for external execution or file manipulation.\n\nThe available functions are for bash commands, editing files, or writing new files, which aren't relevant here. I should just use the information I have.\n\nFinally, structure my response: Answer with just the date as requested.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":4776,"completion_tokens":6,"total_tokens":5336,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":4776,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":554,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":267112250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)","https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1owz6s9/the_us_minted_its_last_penny_see_how_the_coin/","https://www.businessinsider.com/last-penny-history-photos-2025-11","https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/penny","https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-hosts-historic-ceremonial-strike-for-final-production-of-the-circulating-one-cent-coin","https://www.dogonews.com/2025/12/8/no-longer-making-cents-the-last-us-penny-has-been-minted","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","https://finestknown.com/history-of-the-penny/","https://abcnews.go.com/US/pretty-penny-us-cents-sell-167-million/story?id=128411587","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/12/17/penny-auction-results-16-million/87753262007/","https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/penny-short-us-mints-final-1-cent-coins/story?id=127465330","https://www.usmint.gov/news/media-kit/penny","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/us-mints-final-penny.html","https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","https://www.cachevalleydaily.com/news/u-s-mints-last-penny-end-of-an-era-for-the-one-cent-piece/article_5c8827e3-5cce-41b9-8070-552533db836e.html","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/12/pennies-canceled-last-coin-us-mint/87230805007/","https://newsforkids.net/articles/2025/11/20/the-us-mints-its-final-penny/","https://people.com/last-pennies-minted-in-america-sell-for-usd16-7-million-at-auction-11869976","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/penny-out-of-circulation-mint-rcna243486"]}
