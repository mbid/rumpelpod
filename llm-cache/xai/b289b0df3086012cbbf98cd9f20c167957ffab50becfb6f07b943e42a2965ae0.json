I have a function available called \"get_weather\" that retrieves the current weather for a given city.\n\nThe function \"get_weather\" requires a parameter: \"city\", which is a string representing the city name.\n\nI need to respond by calling this function. My response must include a function call in a specific JSON format, enclosed in <function_call> and </function_call> tags.\n\nThe exact format is: <function_call>{\"action\": \"function_name\", \"action_input\": {\"parameter\": \"argument\"}}</function_call>\n\nFor this case, the action is \"get_weather\", and the action_input should be {\"city\": \"Paris\"}.\n\nI should not make my response verbose. Keep it clear and concise.\n\nAfter calling the function, I might need to handle the response, but based on the system prompt, I just need to make the function call in this response.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You are required to call a function to advance the user's request. Your response MUST include a function call...\"\n\nSo, my entire response should just be the function call.\n\nFinally, structure it properly:\n\n<function_call>\n\n{\n\n\"action\": \"get_weather\",\n\n\"action_input\": {\n\n\"city\": \"Paris\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n</function_call>\n\nThat matches the required format.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_84944391","function":{"name":"get_weather","arguments":"{\"city\":\"Paris\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":167,"completion_tokens":26,"total_tokens":461,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":167,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":115},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":268,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb"}
