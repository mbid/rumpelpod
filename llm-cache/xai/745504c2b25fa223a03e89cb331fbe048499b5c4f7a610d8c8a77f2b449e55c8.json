Let me scan through them quickly:\n\n- ‽web:0: Mentions the ceremonial strike for the final production on 2025-11-12.\n\n- ‽web:1: Says the final penny was minted on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:2: Talks about the last 2025 pennies made and auctioned, but doesn't specify the exact date beyond 2025.\n\n- ‽web:3: Refers to November 12 as the last minting date.\n\n- ‽web:4: Mentions President Trump in February, but not the exact date.\n\n- ‽web:5: About an auction in December, not the minting date.\n\n- ‽web:6: States the last penny was minted on Wednesday, November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:7: Same date, November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:8: Published on 2025-12-08, but about the last penny.\n\n- ‽web:9: November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:10: Auction on December 16, but refers to minting in November.\n\n- ‽web:11: Auction date.\n\n- ‽web:12: About the auction.\n\n- ‽web:13: November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:14: Last batch in Philadelphia last week, but the article is from November 19, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:15: November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:16: General info.\n\n- ‽web:17: November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:18: November 12, 2025.\n\n- ‽web:19: About final pennies.\n\nMultiple sources consistently point to November 12, 2025, as the date when the last penny was minted. For example, ‽web:1, ‽web:6, ‽web:7, etc.\n\nThe current date is 2026-01-21, so this information is from the past, and I can use it as it's provided in the context.\n\nThe user specifically asks to \"Search the web,\" but I already have this information from the provided results. The system prompt says: \"You can call functions to retrieve information or perform actions.\" However, there's no specific function for web search; the available functions are \"bash\", \"edit\", and \"write\". None of them directly match a web search.\n\nThe prompt also says: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\" But web search isn't an available function. I should use the provided context if relevant.\n\nThe initial system prompt mentions: \"The following search results... may serve as helpful context,\" and \"You may use this information to formulate your answer.\"\n\nSo, I can directly answer using this information without calling a function, as it's already available.\n\nThe user says: \"Search the web: When was the last US penny minted? Answer with just the date in yyyy-mm-dd format.\"\n\nI should keep my response clear and not verbose. Just provide the date.\n\nFrom the results, the date is 2025-11-12.\n\nI need to format it as yyyy-mm-dd, which it already is.\n\nFinally, respond directly with that.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":4883,"completion_tokens":6,"total_tokens":5638,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":4883,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":749,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":268408250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-hosts-historic-ceremonial-strike-for-final-production-of-the-circulating-one-cent-coin","https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/penny-short-us-mints-final-1-cent-coins/story?id=127465330","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/12/17/penny-auction-results-16-million/87753262007/","https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1owz6s9/the_us_minted_its_last_penny_see_how_the_coin/","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/penny-out-of-circulation-mint-rcna243486","https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/historic-auction-celebrates-232-years-of-the-penny-with-2025-three-coin-sets-featuring-24-karat-gold-cent","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","https://www.dogonews.com/2025/12/8/no-longer-making-cents-the-last-us-penny-has-been-minted","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html","https://people.com/last-pennies-minted-in-america-sell-for-usd16-7-million-at-auction-11869976","https://abcnews.go.com/US/pretty-penny-us-cents-sell-167-million/story?id=128411587","https://apnews.com/article/auction-last-american-pennies-sold-millions-95dab2436556b90cea861730c6004194","https://newsforkids.net/articles/2025/11/20/the-us-mints-its-final-penny/","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/us-mints-final-penny.html","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/12/pennies-canceled-last-coin-us-mint/87230805007/","https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/penny","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/12/last-pennies-minted-auction/87234575007/","https://www.businessinsider.com/last-penny-history-photos-2025-11","https://www.lastuspennies.com/"]}
