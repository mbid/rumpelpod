This appears to be the secret code you were looking for.\n\nBased on web information about secret codes, such strings are often used in contexts like cryptography, hidden messages, or even social media trends (e.g., TikTok codes or puzzles). However, there's no specific definition for this exact code in the available sources. It might be a custom or contextual code for your project.\n\nIf you need more details on its meaning or further analysis, let me know!","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked to run `./once.sh`, which I did, and it produced a large output. Then, I tailed the last 100 lines, and in that output, I see lines like \"Line 3901 0123456789\" up to \"Line 3999 0123456789\", and finally \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nThe search results from the initial context are about \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765 meaning\", so this seems directly relevant. The output ends with \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", which matches the query.\n\nMy role is to be helpful and use the information available. The user might want me to explain or confirm the meaning based on the web results.\n\nFrom the web results:\n\n- There's a result about secret codes in general, like from Vocabulary.com, BBC, etc.\n\n- Specifically, one result is about TikTok's secret number codes, but this is a string, not a number.\n\n- Another is from Reddit about ChatGPT secret codes, but that's not directly matching.\n\n- The query was \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765 meaning\", and now we've got the string itself from the script.\n\nI need to connect this. The web results don't explicitly define \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", but they talk about secret codes in various contexts.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- I could inform the user about what we found.\n\n- Then, use the web results to speculate or provide context on what it might mean.\n\n- If I need more info, ask, but I think I can proceed.\n\nThe conversation is about finding the secret code, and now we have it. The original human message was to run the script and find the code, which we've done.\n\nTo be thorough, I should address the meaning based on the provided context.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"You may use this information to formulate your answer and mention sources if it makes sense to do so.\"\n\nSo, I can say something like: \"Based on the output, we found 'SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765'. From web sources, secret codes often refer to [brief summary], but I don't have a specific meaning for this one.\"\n\nI need to keep it clear and not verbose.\n\nFinally, decide if I need to call another function. Do I? The user's request was to find the secret code, and we've got it. If they want the meaning, I can provide based on context or ask.\n\nThe initial query was about the meaning, but in this interaction, it's about running the script. I should tie it back.\n\nIn the human's first message: \"Run `./once.sh`. It will print a lot of output... Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\"\n\nNow that we've found it, I can confirm and perhaps offer to look into its meaning.\n\nTo advance, I could search or just respond.\n\nThe available functions don't include a direct search; I have to use bash, edit, or write.\n\nThe web results are already provided to me, so I can use them in my response.\n\nI think the next step is to respond with what we found and mention the context from web results.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3903,"completion_tokens":121,"total_tokens":4668,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3903,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":644,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":265518250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://theinformaticists.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/secret-codes/","https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/secret%20code","https://www.rclreads.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2021/05/rmdk_Codes-and-Ciphers.pdf","https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151217-the-secret-codes-youre-not-meant-to-know","https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/secret-language","https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/did-you-know-your-phone-has-secret-codes-that-can-unlock-hidden-features","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3x004o/what_secret_codes_are_all_around_us_that_only/","https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lolmcf/did_you_know_that_chatgpt_has_secret_codes/","https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/shifted-alphabet-code","https://www.playgroupgame.com/secret-code/","https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-puzzles/0/steps/14024","https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/","https://slang.net/blog/tiktok_secret_number_code_meanings","https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/secret-code","https://secretgeek.net/content/spycodes.pdf","https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/secret-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOfBill/comments/1eobtb9/here_are_all_the_secret_codes_ive_gotten_so_far/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/secret-codes-with-meaning/923565169196/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/number-codes-secret-with-meaning/931701020884/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/numbers-secret-code/916792626045/"]}
