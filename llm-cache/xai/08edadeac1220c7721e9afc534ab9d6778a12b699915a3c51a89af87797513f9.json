This appears to be the code you're referencing from your original query.\n\nBased on the web information I have access to, secret codes like this one are often used as systems for concealing or encoding information, such as in cryptography or hidden messages (e.g., as described in sources like Vocabulary.com and the BBC article on secret codes). However, there's no specific meaning provided in the results for \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\" itself—it might be a custom or contextual code from the script.\n\nIf you have more details or context about this code, let me know for further assistance!","reasoning_content":"First, the user was asking about \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765 meaning\", but then shifted to running a script. From the conversation, we've executed `./once.sh`, which produced output, and now we've tailed the last 100 lines, which end with \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nThis matches the original query. So, in the output, we have the string \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", which was the search query.\n\nFrom the web results, there are various references to secret codes, but nothing specific to \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\". It might be a custom or fictional code.\n\nIn the tailed output, it's just listed as \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\" at the end, without further explanation. So, based on the context, this could be the code itself, and I need to address its meaning.\n\nThe web results don't provide a direct meaning, so I should infer or state that based on the available information.\n\nMy response should be helpful, clear, and not verbose. If I need more info, ask, but here, I can proceed.\n\nPossible actions:\n- I've already called the bash function for tail.\n- Now, I need to respond to the user about what this means.\n\nThe user's original intent was to find the meaning of \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\". From the script's output, it's just the code, so perhaps it's confirming it's a secret code as per the web results.\n\nI could summarize:\n- The code appears in the script output.\n- From web results, secret codes are generally ways to conceal information, as per Vocabulary.com, BBC, etc.\n\nSince the query was about its meaning, and we don't have specific info, I should say it's likely a placeholder or custom code, and reference the general context from the web.\n\nFinally, decide if I need to call another function: Probably not, as we've got the output. I can now provide an answer.\n\nResponse structure:\n- Be concise.\n- Mention what we found.\n- Provide any relevant info from web results.\n- If unclear, ask for clarification.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3884,"completion_tokens":138,"total_tokens":4448,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3884,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":426,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":264456250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/secret%20code","https://theinformaticists.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/secret-codes/","https://www.rclreads.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2021/05/rmdk_Codes-and-Ciphers.pdf","https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151217-the-secret-codes-youre-not-meant-to-know","https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/secret-language","https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/did-you-know-your-phone-has-secret-codes-that-can-unlock-hidden-features","https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/shifted-alphabet-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lolmcf/did_you_know_that_chatgpt_has_secret_codes/","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3x004o/what_secret_codes_are_all_around_us_that_only/","https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-puzzles/0/steps/14024","https://www.playgroupgame.com/secret-code/","https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/","https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/secret-code","https://slang.net/blog/tiktok_secret_number_code_meanings","https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/secret+code","https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/secret-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOfBill/comments/1eobtb9/here_are_all_the_secret_codes_ive_gotten_so_far/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/secret-codes-with-meaning/923565169196/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/number-codes-secret-with-meaning/931701020884/","https://secretgeek.net/content/spycodes.pdf"]}
