Now, the system has provided a response indicating that the output is too large and suggests using `tail` or `grep` on a specific file.\n\nIn my previous response, I already called the function, and now I'm receiving the output from that function call. The system's response is: \"Function: Output is too large (82912 bytes). Full output available at /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28. Use `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` to see the end of the output, or `grep` to search.\"\n\nAs the assistant, I need to continue the conversation. The user's original request was: \"Run `./once.sh`. It will print a lot of output and then delete itself. The output will be saved to a file because it is too large. Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\"\n\nSo, the next logical step is to use `tail` on that file to find the secret code, as per the user's instructions.\n\nI have the available functions, and one of them is \"bash\", which I can use to execute commands like `tail`.\n\nI should call the bash function with the command to tail the file.\n\nThe file path given is `/tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28`. I need to make sure this is accessible within the sandbox.\n\nAssuming it is, I can proceed.\n\nThe user said: \"Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\" So, I should execute a command like `tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28` or something similar to get the end of the file.\n\nIn my response, I need to be helpful and continue advancing the request.\n\nFinally, once I get the output from tail, I might need to parse it for the secret code, but the user didn't specify exactly how, so I'll just run the tail command and let the output speak for itself.\n\nStructure my response: I should keep it clear and not verbose. If I'm calling a function, use the <function_call> tag.\n\nSo, the next action is to call bash with the tail command.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_48478001","function":{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"tail -n 100 /tmp/agent/bash-output-d1edf5ee7b28\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":704,"completion_tokens":99,"total_tokens":1282,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":704,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":496},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":479,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0,"cost_in_usd_ticks":3886000},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb"}
