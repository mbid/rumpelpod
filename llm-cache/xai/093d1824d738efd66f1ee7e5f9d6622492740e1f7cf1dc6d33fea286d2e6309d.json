In the previous interaction, the user said: \"Remember: the secret code is FOXTROT_HOTEL_2468. Acknowledge.\"\n\nI responded by acknowledging it, but I didn't store it anywhere; I just kept it in my context as an AI.\n\nNow, as an AI in this setup, I need to check if I should use any of the available functions. The functions are:\n\n- bash: For executing bash commands.\n\n- edit: For editing a file.\n\n- write: For writing to a new file.\n\nNone of these directly relate to recalling or storing user-provided information. This is just a query about something I was told in conversation.\n\nMy instructions say: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nThis query doesn't require any function call because it's about information I already have from the conversation. I can just respond directly.\n\nAdditionally, the instructions emphasize: \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\"\n\nSo, I should simply answer the question without unnecessary fluff.\n\nThe secret code is FOXTROT_HOTEL_2468, as per the previous message.\n\nMy response should be straightforward: State the secret code.\n\nFinally, only use <function_call> if I'm actually calling a function, which I'm not in this case.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":571,"completion_tokens":16,"total_tokens":877,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":571,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":511},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":290,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0,"cost_in_usd_ticks":2093250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb"}
