I have a function available called \"bash\" which allows me to execute bash commands inside a sandboxed environment.\n\nThe \"bash\" function takes a parameter \"command\", which is the bash command to execute. So, for this, the command should be \"cat large.txt\".\n\nThe user specifies to run exactly one tool and then stop immediately, telling them what I observed. I shouldn't run any other tools.\n\nMy response should include a function call for the \"bash\" command. After that, in subsequent interactions, I can report what I observed, but based on the instructions, I need to make the function call now.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call in JSON format within <function_call></function_call> tags.\"\n\nHere, the query is to run `cat large.txt`, which matches the \"bash\" function. The command is clearly \"cat large.txt\".\n\nAfter the function call, I should not do anything else in this response, as per the user's instruction: \"After that single tool call, stop immediately and tell me what you observed.\" But the function call will execute the command, and then in the next turn, I can respond with the output.\n\nThe prompt also says: \"You can call functions to retrieve information or perform actions. ... Call a function decisively if the logical next step...\"\n\nIn my response, I should only include the <function_call> if I'm deciding to call it. The user says \"After that single tool call, stop immediately and tell me what you observed.\" This implies that after the function call, in the next response, I'll have the output to report.\n\nFrom the available actions, the \"bash\" function will execute the command and return the output, which I can then use in my response.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should just make the function call.\n\nFinally, structure: Use <function_call>{\"action\": \"bash\", \"action_input\": {\"command\": \"cat large.txt\"}}</function_call>\n\nI need to ensure my response is not verbose. Just the function call.","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_55980270","function":{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"cat large.txt\"}"},"type":"function"}],"refusal":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":5551,"completion_tokens":27,"total_tokens":6028,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":5551,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":23},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":450,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":268986250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://x.com/0xAsm0d3us/status/1774534254841725016","https://x.com/omespino/status/1001484143426002944","https://x.com/0xAsm0d3us/status/1774534241084445020","https://x.com/LangChain/status/1989006586388574397","https://x.com/freebsdfrau/status/995665551799152640","https://x.com/hackergautam/status/1445412108863041544","https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1767205803881115944","https://x.com/TheMsterDoctor1/status/1951837653411746244","https://x.com/climagic/status/783685657080188929","https://x.com/erniemiller/status/448892002633924608","https://x.com/hackergautam/status/1513605802493644800","https://x.com/0xAsm0d3us/status/1774534245131964600","https://x.com/nixcraft/status/976500064561459200","https://x.com/LinuxHandbook/status/1600791269646663680","https://x.com/hackergautam/status/1445666357920428036","https://x.com/tesh1224/status/1120961757672087552","https://x.com/0xor0ne/status/1628854770982178824","https://x.com/nixcraft/status/928939793508995073","https://x.com/jonasLyk/status/1316101042279452673","https://x.com/Sauers_/status/2012637307715686610"]}
