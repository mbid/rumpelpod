This could be a custom or placeholder code, possibly used in contexts like puzzles, scripts, or hidden messages.\n\nFrom the available web information:\n- Secret codes often refer to encrypted or symbolic strings used for communication, puzzles, or access (e.g., in cryptography or online platforms, as discussed in sources like Vocabulary.com and BBC Future).\n- It might relate to specific uses in AI or apps, such as hidden features in ChatGPT or TikTok codes, but no exact match was found for this string.\n\nIf you need more details or clarification on its meaning, let me know!","reasoning_content":"First, the user is asking about the meaning of \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", and I have web results from a search on that query. But in this interaction, we've just executed some commands and now I have output from `tail` that includes \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nFrom the function output, the last line is: \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\"\n\nThis seems directly related to the user's original query. The web results discuss secret codes in general, like definitions, examples, and various contexts, but none specifically define \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nIn the web results, there's one from Reddit about ChatGPT secret codes, and another about TikTok codes, but nothing matches exactly.\n\nSince the script outputted this string, it might be the key itself. I need to connect this to the user's query.\n\nMy role is to be helpful and use the information available. The user might be expecting me to explain what this code means based on the web results or the context we've just generated.\n\nThe conversation started with the user saying: \"Run `./once.sh`. It will print a lot of output and then delete itself. The output will be saved to a file because it is too large. Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\"\n\nThen, I ran the commands, and now we have the output.\n\nThe original system prompt has a search query about \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765 meaning\", so I should tie this back.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- I could provide an answer based on the web results.\n\n- From the web results, it's not explicitly defined, but there are general explanations.\n\n- One result is from Reddit about ChatGPT secret codes, which might be relevant since I'm an AI.\n\n- Another is about secret codes in general.\n\nThe most straightforward is to say that based on the output, this is the secret code, and perhaps reference the web results for general meaning.\n\nI need to keep my response clear and not verbose.\n\nFinally, decide if I need to call another function. Is there anything else to do? The user might want the meaning, so I could search or provide info from web results.\n\nThe available functions don't include a direct search; I have bash, edit, and write. But I already have the info.\n\nIn the system prompt, it says: \"You may use this information to formulate your answer and mention sources if it makes sense to do so.\"\n\nSo, I can formulate an answer now.\n\nResponse structure:\n\n- Acknowledge what we found.\n\n- Provide any meaning from web results.\n\n- Keep it concise.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3871,"completion_tokens":147,"total_tokens":4547,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3871,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":33},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":529,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":264918750},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://theinformaticists.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/secret-codes/","https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/secret%20code","https://www.rclreads.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2021/05/rmdk_Codes-and-Ciphers.pdf","https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151217-the-secret-codes-youre-not-meant-to-know","https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/secret-language","https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/did-you-know-your-phone-has-secret-codes-that-can-unlock-hidden-features","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3x004o/what_secret_codes_are_all_around_us_that_only/","https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lolmcf/did_you_know_that_chatgpt_has_secret_codes/","https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/shifted-alphabet-code","https://www.playgroupgame.com/secret-code/","https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-puzzles/0/steps/14024","https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/","https://slang.net/blog/tiktok_secret_number_code_meanings","https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/secret-code","https://secretgeek.net/content/spycodes.pdf","https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/secret-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOfBill/comments/1eobtb9/here_are_all_the_secret_codes_ive_gotten_so_far/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/secret-codes-with-meaning/923565169196/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/number-codes-secret-with-meaning/931701020884/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/numbers-secret-code/916792626045/"]}
