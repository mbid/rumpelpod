These results indicate that the last penny was minted in 2025.\n\nLet me review the key results:\n\n- ‽web:4⁊ United States Mint Hosts Historic Ceremonial Strike for Final Production of the Circulating One-Cent Coin - Published: 2025-11-12T00:00:00\n\n- ‽web:6⁊ US Mint presses final pennies as production ends after more than 230 years - Published: 2025-11-12T13:45:35\n\n- ‽web:9⁊ The last-ever penny was minted today in Philadelphia | CNN Business - Published: 2025-11-12T13:45:01\n\n- ‽web:10⁊ U.S. Mint Presses Final Penny After More Than 200 Years - The New York Times - Published: 2025-11-12T18:44:53\n\n- ‽web:15⁊ US Mint says it has stamped its last penny - Published: 2025-11-13T00:00:00\n\n- ‽web:17⁊ A penny short: US mints final 1-cent coins - Published: 2025-11-12T23:13:00\n\n- ‽web:18⁊ It's curtains for the penny - Published: 2025-11-12T21:58:15\n\n- ‽web:19⁊ Watch: Moment the last US penny is minted - Published: 2025-11-13T17:08:31\n\nFrom these, the date consistently pointed to is November 12, 2025. For example, multiple articles are dated 2025-11-12 and describe it as the day the last penny was minted.\n\nThe user specified to answer with just the date in yyyy-mm-dd format. So, I should respond with \"2025-11-12\".\n\nI need to check if I should use a function call. The available functions are:\n\n- bash: For executing bash commands.\n\n- edit: For editing files.\n\n- write: For writing to new files.\n\nNone of these directly relate to searching the web or providing information from existing results. The user's query is about searching the web, but I already have the web results provided in the system prompt. The instructions say: \"You may use this information to formulate your answer and mention sources if it makes sense to do so.\"\n\nIt doesn't instruct me to perform a new web search via a function; instead, I should use the provided results.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nBut there's no function for web searching. So, I shouldn't call a function here because none match.\n\nFinally, the user said: \"Search the web: When was the last US penny minted? Answer with just the date in yyyy-mm-dd format.\"\n\nI can directly answer from the provided context without needing a function call.\n\nMy response should be clear and not verbose, as per the instructions. So, just provide the date.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3554,"completion_tokens":6,"total_tokens":4244,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3554,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":684,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":264096250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1owz6s9/the_us_minted_its_last_penny_see_how_the_coin/","https://www.dogonews.com/2025/12/8/no-longer-making-cents-the-last-us-penny-has-been-minted","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)","https://www.businessinsider.com/last-penny-history-photos-2025-11","https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-hosts-historic-ceremonial-strike-for-final-production-of-the-circulating-one-cent-coin","https://www.usmint.gov/news/media-kit/penny","https://apnews.com/article/us-mint-treasury-department-penny-end-production-86139df5644ef0885a9baf98e9677380","https://abcnews.go.com/US/pretty-penny-us-cents-sell-167-million/story?id=128411587","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/12/17/penny-auction-results-16-million/87753262007/","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/last-penny-minted","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/penny-coin-legacy.html","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/us-mints-final-penny.html","https://people.com/last-pennies-minted-in-america-sell-for-usd16-7-million-at-auction-11869976","https://newsforkids.net/articles/2025/11/20/the-us-mints-its-final-penny/","https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coins-and-medals/circulating-coins/penny","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/12/pennies-canceled-last-coin-us-mint/87230805007/","https://finestknown.com/history-of-the-penny/","https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/penny-short-us-mints-final-1-cent-coins/story?id=127465330","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/penny-out-of-circulation-mint-rcna243486","https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cy4pkgvyn44o"]}
