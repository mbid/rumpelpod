Based on the web information I have access to, secret codes can vary widely in meaning, often used in contexts like cryptography, hidden features, or puzzles (e.g., as discussed in sources like Vocabulary.com or BBC Future). However, without more specific details about this code's origin or context, I can't provide a definitive explanation. If you have additional information or need me to investigate further, let me know!","reasoning_content":"First, the user asked to run `./once.sh`, which prints a lot of output and then deletes itself. I executed a bash command to run it and capture the output with `tail`.\n\nThe function call response is: \"Function: Line 3991 0123456789 ... SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\"\n\nThis seems to be the output from the bash command I called. It ends with \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", which matches the search query from the context.\n\nThe user's original query was about the meaning of \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", and now we've obtained this code from the script.\n\nFrom the web results, there are various references to secret codes, but none directly explain this specific code. For example:\n\n- General definitions of secret codes.\n\n- Articles about codes in various contexts like phones, TikTok, etc.\n\n- But nothing specific to \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\".\n\nSince the script outputted this code, it might be the key itself, or perhaps it's confirming what we have.\n\nMy role is to be helpful. The user might be expecting me to explain or use this code now.\n\nThe conversation started with a search query, but now we've executed a command that produced this output.\n\nI need to decide if I should:\n\n1. Provide the code as the result.\n\n2. Try to explain it using the web results.\n\n3. Ask for more clarification.\n\nThe web results don't provide a direct meaning for this specific code, so I can't conclusively explain it.\n\nHowever, the output directly gives \"SECRET_CODE_XYZ_98765\", which is what the user was searching for.\n\nIn the initial system prompt, it says: \"You may use this information to formulate your answer and mention sources if it makes sense to do so.\"\n\nI should respond with the output and perhaps note that this is the code found.\n\nSince the user said \"The output will be saved to a file because it is too large. Use `tail` to read the end of that file to find the secret code.\", and that's what I did, I can now present the relevant part.\n\nFinally, respond clearly and concisely.\n\nMy response should include the secret code from the output.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2816,"completion_tokens":132,"total_tokens":3392,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2816,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":7},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":444,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":1,"cost_in_usd_ticks":261312250},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb","citations":["https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/secret%20code","https://theinformaticists.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/secret-codes/","https://www.rclreads.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2021/05/rmdk_Codes-and-Ciphers.pdf","https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151217-the-secret-codes-youre-not-meant-to-know","https://www.exploratorium.edu/explore/secret-language","https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/did-you-know-your-phone-has-secret-codes-that-can-unlock-hidden-features","https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lolmcf/did_you_know_that_chatgpt_has_secret_codes/","https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/shifted-alphabet-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3x004o/what_secret_codes_are_all_around_us_that_only/","https://www.playgroupgame.com/secret-code/","https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-puzzles/0/steps/14024","https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/","https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/secret-code","https://slang.net/blog/tiktok_secret_number_code_meanings","https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/secret+code","https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/secret-code","https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOfBill/comments/1eobtb9/here_are_all_the_secret_codes_ive_gotten_so_far/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/secret-codes-with-meaning/923565169196/","https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/number-codes-secret-with-meaning/931701020884/","https://secretgeek.net/content/spycodes.pdf"]}
