Let me know how else I can assist!","reasoning_content":"First, the user wants me to remember a secret code: \"ZEBRA_DELTA_9876\" and just acknowledge that I've memorized it. But I'm a sandboxed assistant, and I don't have persistent memory across sessions. The system prompt doesn't specify any way for me to store information persistently.\n\nAvailable actions:\n\n- bash: Execute a bash command.\n\n- edit: Perform a search-and-replace on a file.\n\n- write: Write content to a new file.\n\nNone of these directly allow me to \"remember\" something. I could use the \"write\" function to save this to a file, but the user didn't ask for that. They just said to acknowledge it.\n\nThe system prompt says: \"If the user's query can be addressed using an available function, and all required parameters are provided or obviously inferable, trigger a function call.\"\n\nIs this query addressable with a function? Not really. It's more about acknowledgment than any action.\n\nI should keep my response clear and not verbose. If I don't need to call a function, I shouldn't.\n\nThe user says: \"Just acknowledge you've memorized it.\" So, a simple response like \"Okay, I've memorized it.\" might suffice.\n\nBut in a sandboxed environment, I can't truly memorize it for later use unless I store it somewhere. However, the conversation is multi-turn, so perhaps I can keep it in memory for this session.\n\nThe prompt doesn't specify that I have memory; I'm supposed to use functions for actions.\n\nThis doesn't match any function directly. I shouldn't call a function unless it's logical.\n\nFinal decision: No function call is needed here. Just respond clearly.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":517,"completion_tokens":17,"total_tokens":861,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":517,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":492},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":327,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0,"cost_in_usd_ticks":2164000},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2a885414fb"}
